Rules for “Whose Line is it Anyway”
Posted On Saturday, February 16, 2008 at 2/16/2008 07:00:00 PM  
At the our Youth Group, we’re often stuck for games to play. But one that can be fun is Whose Line is it Anyway. If you’re not familiar with Whose Line, it’s an improvisational television show that used to be very popular, and it’s also fun to play in youth groups or at parties—as long as people are willing to set aside their shyness, and act. 


For example, here are some games that are easy to play, even with people who aren’t familiar with the show:
* Questions Only: The participants act out a scene, but they’re only allowed to speak in questions. For best effect, there should be two people in the scene, and others on standby; whenever one of the actors says something that’s not a question, that person gets buzzed out, and another takes his/her place.
* The Dating Game: This game involves four people: Three contestants, and one “straight man.” It’s set up like a dating game show, where the three contestants are vying for a date with the “straight man,” except that each of the contestants is assigned a strange identity. (See below for examples of strange identities, that we’ve sometimes used.) The idea is for the contestant to figure out the identities of the contestants, by asking the types of questions somebody might ask on such a game show.

For example, Contestant 1 might be a Muppet. The “straight man” might ask something like, “Bachelor #1, if we were to go on a date, where would you take me?” to which Contestant 1 might answer, “Sesame Street.” That kind of thing.
* Alphabet Game: Two (or more) participants act out a scene, where each line of the scene begins with the next line of the alphabet.

“How are you?”
“I’m fine.”
“Just checking.”
* Commercial Moods: Two participants perform an infomercial for a particular product, and throughout the scene, they occasionally get assigned a mood (angry, happy, sad, etc.), and have to continue the scene in that mood.
* Sound Effects: Two contestants act out a scene, while two other people provide the sound effects for that scene.
* Whose Line: Two participants act out a scene, but throughout the scene, they occasionally have to work in lines which are given to them. They are given these lines on pieces of paper at the beginning of the scene, but aren’t allowed to look at them. It’s easiest to understand if you’ve seen it on the television show; there’s an example transcript online you can read, from the show. Below are some sample lines we’ve used. The stranger they are, the funnier they are during the course of a scene.
These are some examples, but there are numerous others. Really, these are all just improv games, so any improv game will work.

Scenes
Here are some example scenes. As with the strange characters, you should always feel free to create your own.
   * 2 Star Trek fans at a convention
   * 2 candidates for President at a debate
   * 2 astronauts about to leave for a trip to Mars
   * someone at a job interview
   * 2 people on a bus on the way to a historic site
   * 2 people in the army about to go to battle
   * someone buying a pet from the pet shop
   * someone sneaking in food to the movie theatre
   * someone calling the plumber to get the toilet fixed
   * someone trying to get out of a speeding ticket
   * at heaven’s gates with St Peter
   * someone trying to talk their way out of grade 9 initiation
   * James Bond meeting his arch enemy
   * Action scene from the old Batman and Robin
   * one person firing the other, who is begging to keep his/her job
   * A general briefing the president that the Earth is about to be destroyed by a comet
   * Crossing the border, while trying to smuggle a truckload of diapers
   * A commercial for laundry detergent
   * At an old West saloon, waiting for the arrival of the notorious Ugly Gang


   *  United Kingdom  Every Other Line: One performer acts freely while another is given a book or play. That performer responds to the first by reading every other line of the work. The performer who is not reading must end the scene with an audience-suggested line. Played only in series 1, and once in series 4. Common on the radio edition.
      *  United Kingdom  Expert Translation One performer is an expert on a given topic, but can only speak a given foreign language. Another performer translates into English. Played up to series 4. Similar to “Foreign Film Dub”.
         *  English language.svg  Foreign Film Dub: Two performers enact a scene in a foreign language (usually using accented gibberish) chosen by the audience, while the other two performers “translate” into English after each line. This often results in the translators putting the acting performers in compromising situations by translating their gibberish in embarrassing ways. Similar to “Expert Translation”.
            *  United States  Forward Reverse: Two performers start a scene, and two more later enter. Periodically the host  will instruct the performers to go reverse (in my version, any one of the players can initiate the reversal), in which case they must reenact the performed scene backwards, and forward, in which case all reversed actions must be repeated in the proper order as originally. Only for the 2013 revival.
               *  United States  If You Know What I Mean: Three performers improvise a scene in which they make up as many innuendos related to the given topic as they can, ending each with the phrase “if you know what I mean.”
                  *  English language.svg  Number of Words: The four performers act out a given scene. Each is also assigned a number, which is the exact number of words each must use at a time.
                     *  English language.svg  Questions Only: Two performers enact a given scene speaking only in questions, while the other performers wait off-stage, one behind each of them. If either performer speaks in a non-question, or takes too long to respond, the host sounds the buzzer (someone makes a buzzer noise) and they are replaced by the performer behind them. In early UK playings, the game was not a competition and involved only two performers. Similar to “Song Titles”.
                        *  United States  Questions With Wigs: In this variation, the performers must act out the scene as a character dictated by the wig they are wearing. Played twice during the show’s original run, and once during the 2013 revival.
                           *  United States  Questionable Impressions: In this variation, the performers must also do a different impression of their choice each time they enter the game.
                              *  United States  Questionable Impressions From TV: A sub-variation in which all impressions must be of TV personalities. This variation was played only once, on the “Salute to American Television” episode.
