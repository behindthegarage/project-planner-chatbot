Masks are not required outside.\r\n   - Wednesday is a Field Trip day which means your camper NEEDS to wear\r\n   their field trip shirt. (They will receive a shirt their first week).\r\n   - Each child will be assigned a locker in the hallway just outside our\r\n   door. The lockers do NOT have locks on them, so kids should be careful\r\n   about what they choose to bring to camp.
