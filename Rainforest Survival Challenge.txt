Scenario: You are a member of a research expedition originally scheduled to rendezvous with a helicopter at a designated spot deep within the rainforest. However, due to unexpected weather conditions, your group was forced to detour and ended up 20 miles from the rendezvous point. Your radio communication equipment got damaged during the journey, and since survival depends on reaching the rendezvous point, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 20-mile trek. Below are listed the 15 items left intact and undamaged. Your task is to rank order them in terms of their importance for your crew in allowing them to reach the rendezvous point. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important, and so on through number 15 for the least important.

Expert Ranking and Reasoning:        


Item                                Ranking        Expert's Reasoning


Box of matches                12        Usefulness depends on wet conditions and availability of dry wood. Fire is beneficial for warmth and cooking, but rainforest is typically warm and has plenty of edible resources.


High-energy food bars        5        Efficient, compact source of energy.


50 feet of nylon rope                7        Useful for crossing rivers, climbing steep terrain, or setting up shelters.


Rain ponchos                        8        Protection from frequent and heavy rain.


Portable water purifier                3        Rainforest water sources often contain parasites and bacteria. Clean water is essential.


Two flare guns                        9        Good for signaling but only when clearing or helicopter is in sight. Not reliable in dense canopy.




One crate of canned beans        14        Bulky and heavy, less efficient than high-energy food bars.


Oxygen cylinder                15        Unnecessary in a rainforest environment, where oxygen is abundant.


Rainforest map                1        Most important for navigating through the dense and confusing rainforest.


Inflatable raft                        13        Only useful in large bodies of water, which may not be encountered.


Magnetic compass                2        Essential for navigation in conjunction with the map.


20 liters of water                10        Important for hydration but heavy to carry and clean water can be sourced in the rainforest if a water purifier is available.


Signal flares                        6        Useful for alerting any search parties or helicopters, especially in clearings.


First aid kit, & antivenom        4        Essential due to potential for dangerous insect or animal bites.


Solar-powered AM/FM radio        11        Useful for receiving updates if signal can be found, but not essential for survival.

0 - 25 excellent
26 - 32 good
33 - 45 average
46 - 55 fair
56 - 70 poor -- suggests use of urban logic
71 - 112 very poor – you're in real danger in the rainforest!
