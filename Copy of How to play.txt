How to play Family Feud




1. Divide the class into teams.
2. Write numbers on whiteboard for the answers of one of the questions. Do not write the question on the board.
3. One member of each team faces the other in a face-off as the host reads the question off the game board.
4. The one that “buzzed” (bell, slap table, etc) in first makes a guess. If that guess is one of the answers, write the answer on the board with numbers of points next to it. The other team has an opportunity to guess next. The team with the highest ranking answer gains control of the board  the option of playing or passing control to the other team.
5. The team that has the control tries to reveal all of the correct answers to the question before receiving three strikes. Each team member takes a turn if possible. If wrong, the team gets a strike.
6. If the team receives three strikes without clearing the board, control is passed to the other team.
7. The team that now has the control is able to give one answer in the hopes that it is found on the board.
   1. If it is, points are added to the team’s score. 
   2. If not, the other team gets the points.
8. Points are collected as each team finds its answers to the question on the board.
9. Continue the game repeating steps two through eight.
10. Each team tries to collect the most points. The team with the most points wins the game!
