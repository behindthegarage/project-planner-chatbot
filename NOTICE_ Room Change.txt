ATTENTION PARENTS:


We're upgrading room 400 with a new floor! As a result, Club Kinawa will temporarily relocate to the SCHOOL CAFETERIA on Wednesday and Thursday, 5/24 & 5/25, both AM and PM sessions.


Please drop off and pick up your children at the CAFETERIA on these days.


Continue to use DOOR 22 for school entry and exit. A map is provided below to guide you from Door 22 to the cafeteria.


We appreciate your cooperation during this transition. Questions? Please ask a staff member.
