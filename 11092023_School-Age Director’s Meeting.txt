Winter Break plans
We are open December 27-29 & January 3-5.
We need activities, plans, a theme or whatever else. We can do field trips but I need to know those plans by December 1st. If we do field trips, I’d like to do field trips on Fridays if possible.
With Christmas day on a Monday, 12/26 is a paid holiday so this year we don’t need to use PTO to get paid for the 26th.

**********************************************************


Week of December 18-22 **********
NO added days.
Not much staff & staff who are working WILL need to work wherever I need them to keep all five programs open.


Don't let people into the building
If basketball or any other group asks our staff or uses our buzzer system to get in, just tell them you are the before & after care program and you're not sure how they are supposed to get in. It is NOT our responsibility. The barely working buzzer systems were purchased by our programs to let our families in before and after school.
MiRegistry Refresher 2023
I still need: Morgan, Sam S., Evan, Miles. Please talk to your staff about getting this done.
I need all staff to complete the Michigan Ongoing Health and Safety Training Refresher 2023 as soon as possible. Your staff need to go into their miregistry.org account and sign up for it (it’s a free course).


Professional Development Records for each staff member
We all need 16 hours of PD for 2023. If you want me to make an account with cceionline.com for any of your PAs, I can do that in just a few minutes. Let me know who. I can also do carecourses.com or staff can sign up through MiRegistry (would just need my credit card info) on their account.


Make sure ALL sign in sheets get turned into Michelle in a reasonable amount of time. She was entering added days in May from November because she just got the sign in sheet. Also, clearly mark/highlight early drop offs and late pickups so they can be charged.


Pay Increases
