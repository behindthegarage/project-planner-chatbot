Honey or maple syrup
Nuts

Weird item fritos which gave it a salty taste my little brother did this when we were camping


Directions
1.  scoop  ¼ cup of yogurt into a cup or bowl 2. Next put the toppings on that you like. Enjoy ! This is  a fun party!!  My   family  eats this for a snack or even a meal.












      Dragon Egg (:a,ka toad in a hole )  My brothers loved knights and dragons and swords.  We could not get enough books about the mythical creatures.  We played chess and  made our own catapults. So this tradition began of  making  a dragon egg fit for the royal family .I miss my mom. She taught us the love of reading, cooking and using our imagination.
Ingredients 1 to 2 tablespoons butter
*  1 slice bread of your choosing
*  1 egg Salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste
* How to Make It.    
StepI  n a frying pan, melt butter over medium heat.
Step 2 Cut a hole in a piece of bread large enough to fit an egg. I like to use the rim of an 8 ounces jam jar, but get creative and/or resourceful as necessary—cookie cutters, measuring cups, wine glasses, even just tearing a circle with your fingers is fine. Whatever shape you use, save the cutout and set aside—this is called the tire.
Step 3  Crack an egg into the bread hole, being careful not to break the yolk. I like to crack the egg into my jam jar to check for shells, then pour into the hole. Season as desired—pepper is key
                                           












  





 Octopus Hot Dogs! (Mr. Declan Hiawatha B/A) 




One of my Favorite foods growing up was Octopus Hot dogs!


They are super easy, fun, cute and easy to customize. I even make mine with vegetarian hot dogs!


You can make your Octopus Hot dogs any sort of food to swim in but my favorite is Macaroni and Cheese.
























  

 The rules of the game are very simple.


Basically, the object of the game is to score touchdowns. To get a touchdown, you must flick the ball with your finger (you play on a straight edged table) and have the ball stop, with part of it sticking over the table, as seen here. That is 6 points. Players take turns, one flick each back and forth until someone scores. If the ball goes off the table, you kick off. Hold the ball in your hand, resting on the palm, and toss it on the table by hitting your fingers on the underside of the table.


After a touchdown you can kick a field goal. Whoever is kicking holds the ball vertical between his finger and the table, and with his kicking hand, he flicks the ball with his finger. The other person is holding a field goal with his finger arranged in a position, look here If the ball sails between the two posts, its good for 1 point. See it in air here

Science:
Plant Seeds & Watch Them Grow – Science Experiments for Kids
(Ms. Maddy)
 
What you’ll need:
-           Small plastic zipper storage bag
-           Dried, uncooked beans, peas, or seeds
-           Paper towels
-           Water
 
Safety Tips and Hints
-           Dried beans are choking hazards for small children.
-           For this experiment, choose a window where the seeds will get plenty of light, but won’t be blasted by intense sun all day. If your windows are freezing cold, tape the bag to a clear glass or vase in a sunny spot indoor rather than a window.
 
Instructions
1)        Cut a paper towel in half and fold it a few times so it can fit into a zipper storage bag.
2)        Soak the paper towel in water and slide it into the bag. Smooth it so that it’s relatively flat.
3)        Position two beans or seeds about 3 centimeters from the bottom of each bag, on one side of the paper towel. Don’t worry if they don’t stay in place, but if necessary, stable an inch above the bottom of the bag so that seeds are not sitting in water. 
4)        Seal the bag part way, leaving an opening near the top so the growing plants can get some air.
5)   


	  

	

	

	

Tape the bag in a window with the beans facing indoors, so you can watch them grow!

Emotions Art: (Ms. Breanne)
During these confusing times, it is important to focus on mental health for both adults AND children. A good way for children to express emotion is to identify colors that match up with emotions and then paint or color a picture that is full of those emotions. Just because we’re cooped up at home doesn’t mean we have to bottle all of our emotions up!
 
Homemade Bird Feeders: (Ms. Breanne)
Required items - toilet paper roll (empty), peanut butter or nut butter, and bird seed.
Directions - Spread peanut butter or nut butter onto your empty toilet paper roll then role the coated roll in bird seed. You can hang this outside or simply set it outside - with humans not being out and about as much, birds aren’t able to eat the leftovers that humans drop like (bread, popcorn, etc.) so it would be nice of us to give them a little something while we’re at home!

DIY Jellyfish       (Ms. Bianca)
Materials
●          heavy-weight paper bowls
●          white yarn
●          glow-in-the-dark acrylic paint or any acrylic paint
●          paint brushes and painting supplies
●          scissors
●          zipper sandwich bags
●          skewer or sharp pencil
Directions
1.         Paint the bowl inside and out.  Use two or more coats of paint for a brighter "glow".
2.         For the tentacles, cut 10 - 12 pieces of yarn approximately 36 inches in length. Place them in a zipper sandwich bag with several squirts of glow paint and seal the bag.
3.         Squish! Squish! Squish! until the yarn is completely covered, adding more paint if necessary. If the paint is too thick, add a little water to the bag.
4.         Hang the yarn to dry.
5.         At the center of the bowl, punch two holes about 0.5 inch apart using a skewer or sharp pencil.
6.         Cut a piece of yarn approximately 40 inches long.  Thread it through the two holes so that both ends come out the bottom of the bowl.
7.         From the inside of the bowl, pull the yarn up to form a small loop.  Thread the tentacles through and roughly center them under the loop.
8.         Flip the bowl, pull the yarn taut and tie a double knot
9.         Back on the inside, grasp the tentacles as one bunch and tie a single knot.
10.  Unravel a few pieces of yarn that hang close to the center of the bunch.
 
DIY Tornado in a Bottle  (Ms. Bianca)
  

Materials
●           Water
●           A clear plastic bottle with a cap (that won't leak)
●           Glitter
●           Dish washing liquid
Directions
1.         Fill the plastic bottle with water until it reaches around three quarters full.
2.         Add a few drops of dish washing liquid.
3.         Sprinkle in a few pinches of glitter (this will make your tornado easier to see).
4.         Put the cap on tightly.
5.         Turn the bottle upside down and hold it by the neck. Quickly spin the bottle in a circular motion for a few seconds, stop and look inside to see if you can see a mini tornado forming in the water. You might need to try it a few times before you get it working properly.
